# ShopAppSkeleton

Using [medusaJS](https://medusajs.com) for the backend and react native for the front end, this was a pet project for me to learn react native. The tie-ins to the backend are left as an exercise to the reader (haha). 

## Start the project 
- Read the [medusa docs](https://docs.medusajs.com) on how to start medusa backend, add your products, information about them, etc. 
- `npm install && npm run build && npm run ios` from the within the app root directory to start up the app (requires expo/ios simulator).
